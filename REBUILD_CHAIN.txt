# REBUILD_CHAIN.txt

A backup of the main block-chain for each service is retained. This backup will only contain a sub-set of the block-chain. The backup block-chain is stored in the "blockchain/backup/" directory. 

You can review the number of blocks stored by enabling debug mode ("shcoind --debug") and reviewing the log file ("/var/log/share/shcoind.log") while the service is starting up.

On linux, the "blockchain" directory is located in "/var/lib/share/blockchain". On windows, it is located under "%PROGDATA%\share\blockchain\".

The rebuild process will restore all blocks from the backup directory until finished or an error occurs. A block verification error results in the chain being truncated at that block height. Once started up, the service will automatically download the remainder of the blocks from peer nodes.


BACKUP IMPORTANT FILES

The following instructions should be performed before rebuilding a block-chain. In addition, it is recommended to perform these step periodically in order to preserve important information.

1. Make a JSON backup file containing the wallet.
> mkdir -p ~/.shc/
> shc wallet.export ~/.shc/wallet.`date+%b%d.%y.json`

2. Make a JSON backup file containing the peer-list.
> mkdir -p ~/.shc/
> shc peer.export ~/.shc/peer.`date+%b%d.%y.json`

3. Make a backup of the entire "blockchain" directory (i.e. "/var/lib/share/blockchain/" on linux) while the service is NOT running.
> cd /var/lib/share/
> cp -fr blockchain blockchain.`date +%b%d.%y`


REMOVING THE PREVIOUS BLOCK-CHAIN

The following instructions are revert an existing block-chain into a single genesis block. This is required in order to rebuild the block-chain.

1. Stop the shcoind service (if running).
> shc sys.shutdown

2. Remove all files which start with the service's name from the "blockchain" directory except for "XXX_peer.*" and "XXX_wallet.dat". Examples of service names are "testnet" and "shc". 
Note: Retaining the file with a "_wallet.dat" suffix will result in all saved coin addresses (i.e. your wallet balance) being preserved. For the main ShionCoin (SHC) block-chain; the file is "shc_wallet.dat". 
Note: You can alternately restore the wallet or peer-list via the "wallet.import" and "peer.import" RPC commands.
> cd /var/lib/share/blockchain
> cp shc_wallet.dat backup
> cp shc_peer.* backup
> rm shc_*.*
> cp backup/shc_wallet.dat .
> cp backup/shc_peer.* .

Note: You can simply remove "shc_*.*" if you are not intending to retain the current wallet and peer-list.

3. Start up the coin service normally in order for it to generate the genesis block and initialize new database files.
> systemctl start shcoind

Note: You can remove the "shc_peer.*" or "shc_wallet.dat", while the shcoind service is not running, in order to purposely remove your existing wallet or peer-list.


INSTALL BLOCK CHAIN FROM SNAPSHOT

A snapshot of a recent ShionCoin (SHC) block-chain is available at "ftp://ftp.neo-natura.com/snapshot/shc/shc_chain.bin". This snapshot is updated each time a new programmatic block-chain check-point is added to the software. Installing a snapshot is not required to in order for the shcoind service to download the block-chain. 

You can install the snapshot via the following RPC commands:
> cd /tmp
> wget ftp://ftp.neo-natura.com/snapshot/shc/shc_chain.bin
> shc block.import /tmp/shc_chain.bin 


REBUILD BLOCK CHAIN

The following instructions are recommended in order to rebuild a block-chain from the "blockchain/backup/" storage area. The backup block-chain import process will not over-write existing blocks, and therefore it may be neccessary to remove the current block-chain before proceeding (see instructions above).

1. Stop the coin service (if running).
> shc sys.shutdown

2. Start the coin service using the command-line flag associated with the rebuild (--<service>-rebuild-chain). The program will exit once the rebuild has completed.
> shcoind --shc-rebuild-chain -nf


PRUNING BLOCK CHAIN

It is possible to revert a block-chain to a previous height. This process is only recommended to truncate the tail of the block-chain by 50,0000 blocks or less.

This process will revert all transactions associated with the blocks being truncated. Transactions will be processed again once the block-chain is redownloaded.

1. Start the shcoind service in admin mode.
> shc sys.shutdown
> mkdir -p ~/.shc/
> echo "admin=1" >> ~/.shc/shc.conf
> systemctl start shcoind

2. Prune the block-chain with the administrative "block.purge" RPC command.
> shc block.purge <block-height>

3. Stop the shcoind service.
> shc sys.shutdown

4. Remove the "<service>_*.arch" files from the "blockchain" directory.
Note: This ensures that unwanted orphan blocks are not re-introduced when the truncated portion of the block-chain is re-downloaded.
> cd /var/lib/share/blockchain
> rm shc_*.arch

4. Start the shcoind service.
> systemctl start shcoind

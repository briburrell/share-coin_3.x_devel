== Abstract ==
This SIP defines a new Executable Extended Transaction that is used in order to provide smart-contract capabilities.

The executable extended transaction consists of publishing a SEXE class and sub-sequent calls to methods in that class. A persistent data storage mechanism is provided which is synchronized between all nodes. 

== Motivation ==
The executable extended transaction provides the capability to create programs which can define rules for a system of operations that deliver consistent results among all participants.

== Examples ==
One of the most popular examples of a smart-contract program is the Token asset. A token tracks an arbitrary metric that can be defined as having a interinsic value based of the intended purpose of it's use. 

==Specification==
The SEXE programming language is based off of the LUA scripting language. The libshare runtime suite is used in order to provide the development environment. 

The executable extended transaction consists of the generation of a new SEXE class on the blockchain or calling a method from a published class.

The SEXE class is provided a permanent data storage area in order to update variables based on the functions called. 

The SEXE class can require a SHC coin payment in order to perform an operation. Class method calls that do not require a change to the permanent data storage area do not require a payment. The minimum fee for a class call which modifies the data storage area is 0.00001 SHC. 

When a class calls is received by a node the basic integrity is validated. The actual execution of the call will only occur on a 'as needed' basis, in that, a user must specifically require the use of a SEXE class before any preceding operations are performed.

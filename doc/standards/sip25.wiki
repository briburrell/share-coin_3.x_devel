==Abstract==

This SIP defines a new transaction called a "Asset". A asset is derived from an already established certificate.

==Specifications==
An asset contains a title of up to 135 characters, an coin address of the creator, a parent chain certificate hash, and a data payload. 

Asset transaction initially cost around 8 SHC and goes down over time. 

An asset will include the geodetic location of the node which generated the transaction unless the node is configured otherwise.

Assets provide a method to attach auxiliary information to a certificate. The asset may itself be a reference (such as a barcode) or contain authority/proprietary information by itself. Up to 4095 characters may be used for the payload.

An asset will expire when the underlying certificate expires (which is after 48 years).

==Abstract==

This SIP defines a new extended transaction called a "parameter" that is attached to coinbase and normal fund transfer transactions. The structure defines a set of rules that are being proposed for the blockchain. 

==Motivation==

The "extended parameter transaction" provides the ability to dynamically change aspects of the blockchain based on a user concensus.

==Specification==

This SIP introduces two initial parameters; the "maximum block size" and the "minimum relay fee".

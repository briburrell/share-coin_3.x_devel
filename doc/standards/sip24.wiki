==Abstract==

This SIP defines a new transaction called a "License". A license is derived from an already exstablished certificate.

==Specifications==
A license contains a title of up to 135 characters, an coin address of the creator, and a parent chain certificate hash. A fee must be paid to generate the license if the certificate being derived specifies one. In addition to any certificate fee, a 0.0001 SHC transaction fee is applied.

A license will include the geodetic location of the node which generated the transaction unless the node is configured otherwise.

Licenses are used in order to indicate a usage of a certificate's context. For example, a software or audio license may be require to be attained before the program will run or be played.

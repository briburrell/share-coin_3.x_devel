==Abstract==

This SIP defines a new structure called a "matrix" that is committed to blocks as an extended transaction.

==Motivation==

The matrix extended transaction is used to store a set of numbers computed with a arbitrary algorythm.

==Implementation==

The matrix extended transaction uses the core extended transaction structure with the addition of the following variables:
<pre>
nType (uint32)
  The type of matrix.
nHeight (uint32)
  An associated block height.
hRef (uint16)
  Reserved.
vData (uint32[3][3])
  The payload contents of the matrix.
</pre>

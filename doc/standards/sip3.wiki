==Abstract==

This SIP defines a new structure called a "certificate" that is committed to blocks as an extended transaction.

The certificate extended transaction provides a means to certify credentials.

==Motivation==

The certification of auxilliary information provides a method to track identity association and provide credentials to third-party software.

==Specifications==

The Certification of a transaction is performed by creating chains of extended transactions which utilitize an "Ident" structure or a "Certificate" structure (see below).

Several other extended transactions utilize the "Ident" or "Certificate" extended transaction structure as a base. 

===Structure===
The "Ident" extended structure consists of the following;
<pre>
	{
		/* A geodetic location. */
		shgeo_t geo;
		/* A coin address key. */
		cbuff vAddr;
		/* A mode indicator. */
		unsigned int nType;
	}
</pre>

The "Certificate" extended structure is a extension of the "Ident" structure which includes the following;
<pre>
	{
		/* A reference to a parent record. */
		uint160 hashIssuer;
		/* A signature generated from the underlying transaction. */
		CSign signature;
		/* A free-form data pay-load. */
		cbuff vContext;
		/* The fee charged to derive this certificate. */
		int64 nFee;
		/* An attribute modifier. */
		int nFlag;
	}
</pre>


===Usage===

An "Ident" by itself can be embedded into a "transfer funds" operation as part of a certified send or by "stamping" some auxilliary information.

The "Certificate" structure is used by certificates, licenses, and assets. Typically, a chain authority certificate is generated and then derived certificates are assigned for auxilliary purposes. A license differs, in that, it can be derived from a suitable certificate, with a optional fee, without the consent of the owner.

An asset is derived from a certificate, and provides a 4k payload of information referencing a tangible asset.
